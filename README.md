The data for this assignment comes from NOAAâ€™s Storm Events Database. This data lists major weather-related storm events since 1950. Here is the link to access the database: https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/ 


The data I used was from the year in which I was born, 1997. I retrieved and prepared the dataset for analysis.
