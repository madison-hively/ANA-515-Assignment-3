# ANA-515-Assignment-3

The data for this assignment comes from NOAAâ€™s Storm Events Database. This data lists major weather-related storm events since 1950. Here is the link to access the database: https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/ 


The data I used was from the year in which I was born, 1997. 

The additional files in the repository are: Assignment 3 - Storm Events 1997.R (accompanying R code for this assignment) and Storm Events 1997 Plot (screenshot of the plot created)
